# DishniCars Frontend

## Introduction

The DishniCars frontend was initially developed for Netlify, taking into account their backend services and the capabilities of serverless functions. This allowed for quick and efficient deployment of the website, simplified content management through a CMS, and utilization of other platform tools.

## Transition to Full Stack Development

The project evolved, and it was decided to create our own backend to fully cover the entire development cycle and operate with our own database, thereby increasing control and flexibility. Link to the backend: [DishniCars Backend](https://github.com/Maysker/dishnicars-backend).

## Functionality and SEO

The frontend is optimized for search engines and has responsive design, ensuring proper display on all types of devices.
